# Course feedback

The content of this course was absolutely great; all the current technologies were covered in required detail. 

The [website](http://mobile.pages.labranet.jamk.fi/mobile-application-development) containing the course info and materials was superb! The website and the material supplied there was better than any learning environment on a similar subject(software/programming) has been so far in my studies, thanks for going through the trouble of creating all that!

There's not much to improve on the materials or exercises in my opinion. Some things that I exposed in my learning comments already were things needing updating like:

* Audit is now named Lighthouse inside Chrome
* A quick start guide on getting a LabraNet webserver up and running (or, getting access to it) in the start of the course

It's hard to imagine you could add much more to this course with contact studies since the materials cover everything needed. Maybe it could help to ask the lecturer about the CSS involved as that seemed to be the stumbling block in most of the exercises. The logic was quite easy to create on most parts but getting that UI to look even half-decent was 75% of the course for me. *Maybe it's wouldn't be a bad idea to supply all the required CSS in the exercise handout to let the students focus on learning to think in React?*

Workload-wise, the course was OK. I think I could've accomplished all the tasks but I had to redirect my focus to my other summer studies -project to make sure I can release it in time. Maybe some of the exercises seemed a bit off placement-wise since some of them took a full work day and then some while the next exercise after that might've taken an hour to do but for all I know this might be completely intended.

I have no real comment on evaluation, I just hope this exercise #20 pushes me past the 80% mark :)
I probably could've done the research assignment too if I had budgeted my time a bit better throughout the summer (I had mostly 3-4 days of other project and 1-2 days of this course).

I also thoroughly enjoyed the exercise turn-in system of using GitLab boards since this helped me to get used to the feature in general as I've not used it much in the past and it was very easy and basically integrated to a normal development cycle.

Overall, I would rate this course a **5/5**, *"would study again"* :)

# Self-evaluation

I've learned quite a bit during this course. I think I've learned more about mobile development during this course than I've learned about it in the past 2 years. Now I know the basics of:

* PWA
* React/React Native
* APIs
  * XHR/Fetch/Getting data online
* NPM
* Yarn
* Expo
* CLIs
* Ads
* Android apps in general
* Cross-app traversal
* Setting up a React environment in multiple ways
* And a bunch of "standard" packages used in app development

...and probably much more littler or larger things that don't instantly come to mind. This is all the stuff I kind of wished I'd learn on this course so this was perfect for me.

I'd rate myself a 3/5 or 4/5 since I did not complete the research assignment but got most of the rest done and learned A LOT. :)
